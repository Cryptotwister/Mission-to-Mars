# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview:
A junior data scientist Robin does freelance astronomy work in her spare time. Her dream is to land a position with NASA someday. So, she spends a lot of time visiting sited with news about space exploration, especially the mission to Mars. She has an idea to write a script that would gather all the information she searches for into a one convenient location. If its polished enough it may get NASAâ€™s attention.
She plans to build a web application that will scrape new data from web every time she tells it to at the click of a button. She wants us to help her write the python script that can navigate the webpages to collect the information. We then then need to store gathered information, paragraphs and images in a non-SQL database MongoDB. To put it all together in a web application using python we will need to use Flask and then customize it with HTML and CSS.
